## Overview

This application provides a comprehensive platform for managing medications and verifying clinical trial representation. It includes three main features:

1. **Clinical Trial Representation Verification**  
   Users can check whether they would have been represented in clinical trials for a medication based on demographics such as gender, race, and age.

2. **Medication Interaction & Reminder System**  
   The system alerts users to potential interactions between medications and supplements. It also provides automated medication reminders via email.

3. **Medication Knowledge Chatbot**  
   A chatbot allows users to get simple, safe information about medications including side effects, uses, and general guidance, with built-in safety measures to prevent inappropriate medical advice.
